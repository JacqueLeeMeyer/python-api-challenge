## Module 6 Challenge

This challenge consisted of two Jupyter Notebooks:

The first was WeatherPy which created a Python script to gather the weather data of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator, using Open Weather Map API, and create several scatter plots to visualize it.

The following are examples of the Scatter Plots:

The second was VacationPy which used the ouptput of the WeatherPy to filter desired vacation locations and determine the nearest hotels. 

The following is the final map showing desired locations:
